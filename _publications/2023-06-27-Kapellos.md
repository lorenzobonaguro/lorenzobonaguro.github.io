Systemic inflammation is established as part of late-stage severe lung disease, but molecular, functional, and phenotypic changes in peripheral immune cells in early disease stages remain ill defined. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major respiratory disease characterized by small-airway inflammation, emphysema, and severe breathing difficulties. Using single-cell analyses we demonstrate that blood neutrophils are already increased in early-stage COPD, and changes in molecular and functional neutrophil states correlate with lung function decline. Assessing neutrophils and their bone marrow precursors in a murine cigarette smoke exposure model identified similar molecular changes in blood neutrophils and precursor populations that also occur in the blood and lung. Our study shows that systemic molecular alterations in neutrophils and their precursors are part of early-stage COPD, a finding to be further explored for potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for early diagnosis and patient stratification.
