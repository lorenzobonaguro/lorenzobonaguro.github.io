Blastocyst-derived stem cell lines were shown to self-organize into embryo-like structures in 3D cell culture environments. Here, we provide evidence that embryo-like structures can be generated solely based on transcription factor-mediated reprogramming of embryonic stem cells in a simple 3D co-culture system. Embryonic stem cells in these cultures self-organize into elongated, compartmentalized embryo-like structures reflecting aspects of the inner regions of the early post-implantation embryo. Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals transcriptional profiles resembling epiblast, primitive-/visceral endoderm, and extraembryonic ectoderm of early murine embryos around E4.5–E5.5. In this stem cell-based embryo model, progression from rosette formation to lumenogenesis accompanied by progression from naïve- to primed pluripotency was observed within Epi-like cells. Additionally, lineage specification of primordial germ cells and distal/anterior visceral endoderm-like cells was observed in epiblast- or visceral endoderm-like compartments, respectively. The system presented in this study allows for fast and reproducible generation of embryo-like structures, providing an additional tool to study aspects of early embryogenesis.
