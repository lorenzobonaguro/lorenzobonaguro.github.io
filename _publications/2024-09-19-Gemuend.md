In this study we established a comprehensive workflow to collect multi-omics single-cell data using a commercially available micro-well based platform. This included whole transcriptome, cell surface markers (targeted sequencing-based cell surface proteomics), T cell specificities, adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) profiles and sample multiplexing. With this technique we identified novel paired T cell receptor sequences for three prominent human CMV epitopes. In addition, we review the ability of dCODE dextramers to detect antigen-specific T cells at low frequencies by estimating sensitivities and specificities when used as reagents for single-cell multi-omics.
