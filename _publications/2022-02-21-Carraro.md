Omics-based technologies are driving major advances in precision medicine but efforts are still required to consolidate their use in drug discovery. In this work, we exemplify the use of multi-omics to support the development of 3-chloropiperidines (3-CePs), a new class of candidate anticancer agents. Combined analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility elucidated the mechanisms underlying sensitivity to test agents. Further, we implemented a new versatile strategy for the integration of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, able to accelerate and extend the standalone analyses of distinct omic layers. This platform guided the construction of a perturbation-informed basal signature able to predict cancer cell lines’ sensitivity and to further direct compound development against specific tumor types. Overall, this approach offered a scalable pipeline to support the early phases of drug discovery, understanding of mechanism and potentially inform the positioning of therapeutics in the clinic.
