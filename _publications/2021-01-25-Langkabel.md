Blastocyst-derived stem cell lines were shown to self-organize into embryo-like structures in 3D cell culture environments. Here, we provide evidence that synthetic embryo-like structures are generated solely based on transcription factor-mediated molecular reprogramming of embryonic stem cells in a simple 3D co-culture system. ESCs in these cultures self-organize into elongated, compartmentalized synthetic embryo-like structures over the course of reprogramming exhibiting anterior visceral endoderm formation and symmetry breaking. Single-cell RNA-Seq reveals transcriptional profiles resembling epiblast, visceral endoderm, and extraembryonic ectoderm of early murine embryos around E4.5–E5.5. Within the epiblast, compartment marker gene expression supports primordial germ cell specification. After transplantation, synthetic embryo-like structures implant in uteri and initiate the formation of decidual tissues. This system allows for fast and reproducible generation of synthetic embryo-like structures, providing further insights into synthetic embryology.
