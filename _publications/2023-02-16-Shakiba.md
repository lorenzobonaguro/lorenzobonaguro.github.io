The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the potentially devastating impact of novel respiratory infections worldwide. Insightful data obtained in the last years have shed light on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of the inflammatory response in driving both the resolution of the disease and uncontrolled deleterious inflammatory status in severe cases. In this mini-review, we cover some important aspects of the role of T cells in COVID-19 with a special focus on the local response in the lung. We focus on the reported T cell phenotypes in mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, focusing on lung inflammation and on both the protective and damaging roles of the T cell response, also highlighting the open questions in the field.
