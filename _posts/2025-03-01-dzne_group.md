What a blast! The Bonaguro lab is officially opening at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Bonn.

Our research group will explore the relationship between environmental exposures, lifestyle choices, and the process of immune aging. We're particularly interested in understanding how these factors influence the overall health and resilience of populations.

We're excited to collaborate with the exceptional scientific community at DZNE, the University of Bonn (Uni Bonn), the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), and ImmunoSensation.

We are immensely grateful to the European Research Council (ERC), DZNE, and ImmunoSensation for their support of our research.

And most importantly thanks to the young scientist who joined my team in this new adventure!
