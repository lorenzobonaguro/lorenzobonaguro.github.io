**Jacqueline** presented a poster at the **Clusters Science Days 2024**. She shared insights from her project, **ImmuDiet**, where she's using advanced high-dimensional technologies to study the effects of dietary interventions on the peripheral immune system. 

By understanding how different diets influence the homeostasis and activation potential of our circulating immune cells, we can provide valuable recommendations to the public for improving overall health.
