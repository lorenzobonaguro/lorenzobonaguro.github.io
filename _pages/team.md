In my group in molecular and translational immunomics, I want to take advantage of a system-level omics approach to understand the molecular mechanisms of physio-pathological immunological processes (Bonaguro et al. Nat. Imm, 2022b). As an overarching concept, I combine classical hypothesis-driven research approaches with the concept of utilizing high-resolution, high-content technologies, in combination with state-of-the-art analytical approaches including the most advanced AI approaches. I am particularly interested in the effect of environmental perturbations on the capacity of the immune system to respond to challenges. In this context, I am studying the impact of diet and ageing on the immune system's response to challenges and vaccination. I am doing this by combining clinical cohorts, model systems (tonsil organoids), and computational methods to understand the molecular mechanism underlying immune fitness.
