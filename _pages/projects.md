There is growing evidence that currently used toxicological assessments of chemicals fail to fully capture their actual biological activity. While chemicals are routinely tested for acute toxic effects, often at high concentrations, potential function-modulating effects at low concentrations are often underexplored. The inclusion of up-to-date high-resolution methods in the toxicological screening praxis would allow instead to fully capture the complex bioactivity profile of these compounds, which depends on numerous aspects including bioavailability, route of exposure and individual susceptibility. While the last 100 years have seen an enormous number of chemicals introduced into our daily life, of which a large number are well-known to persist in the environment, a sufficient understanding of their bioactivity potential is lacking. Also based on growing evidence, it is not far-fetched to hypothesize that some of these industrial chemicals could be partly responsible for the constant increase of non-communicable diseases including autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases but also cancer or (neuro)degenerative diseases. Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are a class of xenobiotics with proven strong toxicity at high-level exposure, while little is known about their bioactivity at concentrations commonly detected in human samples. Considering their high stability and ubiquitous occurrence in the environment and human body, exposure to PFAS has reached a pandemic scale. I postulate that it is of outmost importance to finally dissect the potential of these compounds to molecularly interfere with organ functionalities at the single-cell level using state-of-the-art high-resolution omics technologies. Supported by an interdisciplinary training in pharmacology, systems immunology, omics, animal and cellular models, and bioinformatics, I represent a prime candidate to successfully develop this project and clarify the bioactivity of PFAS.

High-dimensional cytometry (HDC) is a powerful tool for studying single-cells phenotypes in a complex system. Although in recent years the combination of technological developments and affordability have made HDC broadly available, these technological advances were not paired with the adequate development of analytical methods to take full advantage of the data generated. While several platforms and bioinformatics tools are currently available for the analysis of HDC data, they are either web-hosted with limited scalability or designed for expert computational biologists, making them difficult to approach by wet lab scientists. Additionally, the need for end-to-end HDC data analysis tools within a unified ecosystem poses a significant challenge, as researchers must navigate multiple platforms and software packages to complete the analysis. We developed an easy-to-use computational framework (condor) covering not only all of the essential steps of cytometry data analysis but also including an array of downstream functions and tools to expand the biological interpretation of the data. condor's comprehensive suite of features, including guided pre-processing, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning algorithms, facilitates the seamless integration of condor into clinically relevant settings, where scalability and disease classification are paramount for the widespread adoption of HDC in clinical practice. Additionally, condor's advanced analytical features, such as pseudotime analysis and batch integration, provide researchers with the tools to extract deeper insights from their data. We used condor on a variety of data from different tissues and technologies demonstrating its versatility to assist the analysis of high dimensionality data from preprocessing to biological interpretation.
