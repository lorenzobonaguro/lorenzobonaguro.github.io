Our research group in **molecular and translational immunomics** uses a systems-level omics approach to understand how the immune system functions in health and disease. We integrate classical hypothesis-driven research with high-resolution, high-throughput technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, and advanced analytical methods, including artificial intelligence approaches. 
Specifically, we are interested in how environmental exposures like diet and pollution affect the immune system's ability to respond to challenges. We investigate the exposome's influence on immune response and vaccination efficacy using model systems like tonsil organoids and computational tools to decipher the molecular mechanisms that govern immune fitness.
